## General remarks

These lecture slides were used during the first part of the course Applied Urban and Real Estate Economics, a core module in the MSc Real Estate Economics and Finance at the London School of Economics. I last taught this course in Fall 2023. While I occasionally update the slides, they are no longer maintained regularly. You are free to use the content from these slides, provided appropriate credit is given. When doing so, please cite the slides as:
